           Everyone agrees that gentrification happens: rising rents, displacement of working-class populations, sedimentation of racial disparities, architectural conformity. But Jerald Cooper, creator of @hoodmidcenturymodern, only used the word “gentrification” once during our conversation, and it wasn’t your typical take. His project, stemming from an Instagram account (25k followers and counting), doesn’t explore gentrification as much as talk around it, its prehistory for Black communities. “We don’t even fucking know our neighborhood,” he says. “I mean, generally speaking, nobody knows about these neighborhoods. Nobody knows who had originally settled there, what the functions of these neighborhoods were, why some of the people left, why people came. How do we protect things that we don’t know anything about?”

           <br>

The expansive HOOD CENTURY project, then, becomes a place to study one’s surroundings, becomes a study of one’s place not in the world—that totalizing distant thing—but in one’s own neighborhood. The @hoodmidcenturymodern Instagram Linktree is a bit like a syllabus, listing a website about Black architect Paul Revere Williams, a podcast on how buildings relate to health and happiness, a Nowness documentary on Watts, an academic paper called “Progressive Architecture for the Negro Baptist Church." And there’s music—a link to blues singer Little Milton singing, “You know it hurts me so bad / To hear my baby say goodbye / That’s why I walked the backstreets / The backstreets and cry.” <br>

With @hoodmidcenturymodern, Cooper has created a guide to the multidimensional realization of where you’re at. In the last ten years, he's lived in New York City, London, and Los Angeles, claiming the professional identity of a manager and creative director. Last year, though, at the Noah Davis show at David Zwirner, he realized he’s an artist now. From his mother’s “really cute deck” at his childhood row house in College Hill, Ohio, “Coop” and I discussed preservation societies, the Underground Railroad as Black design, Cleveland's black literary history, and the difference between study and education.
